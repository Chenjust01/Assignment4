The first test we have one cooperator and 9 defector. We hypothesize that there will be little cooperation within the group of organism. When we did the test, the mean cooperation was 0. This is what we expected. One Cooperator is not strong enough to overcome the defectors, since most of the population refuse to cooperate with each other then there will be little distrubition of energy. This will lead to little cooperation. 

The second test we did have 9 cooperator and 1 defector. We hypothesize that there will be many cooperation within the organsim and the mean will most likely to be 1. After we did the test we got what we mostly expected. In most cases, the organism cooperated with each other, however, there was one instance where the organism did not cooperate with each other as much. The outlier was 0.4. Having many Cooperator will increase the rate of cooperation since there are more organism who are willing to cooperate with each other. 

There third test we did have 3 cooperator, 3 defector, and 4 partial defector. We hypothesize having a higher percentage of defector will decrease percentage of cooperation amoung the organism. After we did the test we got the following result: 0.6. 0.1, 0.6, 0.2, 0.4, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3. The average rate of cooperatition was 0.21. We got the result that we had expected. The result shows us that increasing the amount of defector will greatly affect the organism. 

The fourth test we did have 1 cooperator, 9 defector, and 9 partial defector. We hypothesize that the defetor will strongly effect the organisms and will significantly decrease the cooperation rate. The result shows us that there is 0 cooperation amoung the the organism. This result supported our speculation since the defector did affect the cooperation and decrease it. There are too many defector in the group, therefore the cooperator could not cooperate with any organism. 

The fifth test we did have 99 cooperator, 1 defector, and 0 partial defector. We hypothesize that there will be almost 100% cooperation rate. The result is the following: 0.28, 0.15, 0.22, 0.13, 0.15, 0.1, 1.0, 0.13, 0.11, 0.13 and the average is 0.15. The result does not support our claim. It seems like the defector is heavly weighted and can outweigh the cooperator. This is why we did not see a high cooperation rate amoung the organism. 

The sixith test 33 cooperator, 33 defector, 34 partial defector. We hypothesize that there will be a low rate of cooperation since the defector will most likely make most of the organism not cooperate with each other. The result is the following: 0.04, 0.11, 0.03, 0.01, 0.07, 0.05, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.03 and the average is 0.04. This result supported our hypothesis because there was a low cooperation rate amoung the organism. We believe this is caused by the defectors and the defectors tends to weigh more in terms of the cooperation rate. 

In conclusion, cooperator will thrive in an enviroment where there is little or to no defector. Cooperator will go extinct if there is a defector. It seems like having one defector will lead to little cooperation, thus lead to the cooperator to extinct. Also, partial defector will tend to cooperate when there is little defector.
